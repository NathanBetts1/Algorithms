# Algorithms - Nathan Betts
#### Spring Trimester, 2020

Collection of my Implementations of Algorithms covered in my Computer Science Algorithm Module, this collection lead to my greater understanding of 
Algorithmic Complexity,  Searching \ Sorting Algorithms and File Compression

### Build and run
Clone the repository into your IDE and build the project.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the preferred IDE for the project.


## Description:

- Compression Algorithms 
    - Run Length Encoding 
    - Huffman Compression
- Dynamic Programming
    - Fibonacci
    - Knapsack
    - Longest Common Substring
    - (with Brute-Force / Recursive Implementations to show efficiency)
